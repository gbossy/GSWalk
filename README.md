This repository contains my thesis on the Gram-Schmidt Walk and most of the code used to run experiments and produce figures within. 

What most people could find most interesting is my thesis report, which is the .pdf file in the report folder, and the GSW implementation in gsw.py. 

Note that some modes and configurations will not work when combined and warnings may not have been implemented in the code.

Some additional code is sometimes defined in the notebooks for some experiments. The notebooks are here more for me than for potential interested researchers, as they haven't been cleanly linked to which experiment they're associated with in the report if they're even in the report. 

***If you are to use all or part of this code please cite me and this repository and do not hesitate to message me any application or research using the GSW.***
